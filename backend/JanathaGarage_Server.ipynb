      "Context:  later in Chapter 9. An illustration showing pistons (gray) in their respective cylinders (blue) and a crankshaft (red). As the pistons go up and down the crankshaft is rotated. This image is animated at In a diesel engine there are no spark plugs. The fuel is ignited based on compression alone. The compression is higher on a diesel engine, which generates enough heat to cause the combustion. A hybrid vehicle uses an electric motor and battery for assisting propulsion along with the internal combustion engine. The internal combustion engine generates electricity to recharge the batteries. Also, the batteries are recharged when braking to a stop. Engine Oil Sample of motor oil The purpose of engine oil is to form a film of lubrication between all moving parts of an internal combustion engine to reduce friction and wear. Choosing the right engine oil for your vehicle and changing the oil during regularly-scheduled maintenance intervals will keep the engine running smoothly over time. The recommended oil type and specification for your vehicle can be found in the owners manual. Another place to find it is on the oil fill cap. It will be based on the ambient temperature where you live. There are two engine oil codes that the owner(cid:1)s manual will specify, an API and an SAE. All oil has an API code which stands for American Petroleum Institute. Its a service rating for the quality, cleanliness, and types of detergents in the oil. The code will always be two letters. The SAE is the viscosity or thickness of the oil. Modern oil is multi-viscosity oil. The SAE may be something to the effect of 5W-30. The first number-letter combo (5W) indicates the viscosity or thickness of the oil when it is cold. The second number is the viscosity at the engine operating temperature. Before they had multi-viscosity oil there was only single-viscosity oil (such as SAE 30), which in cold weather was extremely thick. Trying to pour it into your engine would be like pouring honey, but more importantly it would be hard to pump the oil\n",
      "finally opened. Almost any topic regarding your vehicle(cid:1)s maintenance can be found in the index. Owner(cid:1)s Manual The owner(cid:1)s manual will have a maintenance chart. The chart will include such information as when to change the oil, rotate tires, replace the air filter, inspect fuel cap and lines, change other fluids (transmission fluid, etc.) and other maintenance issues. Your vehicle may have different maintenance requirements at 30,000 miles, 90,000 miles, 150,000 miles and at other intervals as indicated specifically in your owner(cid:1)s manual. Being familiar with the maintenance chart in your owner(cid:1)s manual can help you save money when taking your car to the mechanic for maintenance checks. Sometimes the repair shop will suggest additional services that aren(cid:1)t necessary. If you don(cid:1)t have the owner(cid:1)s manual for your car then you may be able to find one online by using Google or another search engine. Search the website for the make of the vehicle. You could also try your local library. Vehicle Fluids: Vehicle fluids include brake fluid, engine oil, coolant, power steering fluid, windshield washer fluid, transmission fluid and battery fluid. Fluid level information and the location of each fluid reservoir can be found in the owner(cid:1)s manual for your particular vehicle. (Any images in this chapter are illustrative of one example and your vehicle may look different). Brake Fluid: On most vehicles the reservoir for brake fluid is clear. You can check the fluid without removing the cap. There will be a marking on the reservoir that indicates minimum and maximum level. You(cid:1)ll want to make sure that the level is between those two marks. This fluid should never need to be topped off during maintenance. Low fluid is an indication of a problem. If the fluid is low then you may want to bring it to a mechanic, depending on your own skill level. Most vehicles have a dashboard light that illuminates when the brake fluid is low.

Here are some general guidelines for changing a tire (in order): Make sure the vehicle is on level ground (see Chapter 1, Safety, proper lifting points) Apply the parking brake Remove the spare tire and tools from the vehicle Use wheel chocks to block the wheels opposite of the wheel you(cid:1)re changing (i.e. if you(cid:1)re changing a rear tire, then put the chocks in front of the front wheels). o Wheel chocks are similar to triangle-shaped door stoppers. When chocks are included with the tire changing kit, then they should be used. However, they are not present with every vehicle. Cases where they(cid:1)re not present may include vehicles with a rear parking brake and front wheel drive. When changing a rear wheel in these vehicles the front wheel drive keeps the vehicle stable, and when changing a front wheel in these vehicles the rear parking brake keeps the vehicle stable. Loosen the lug nuts before lifting the vehicle, but do not remove Pump or crank the jack to lift the vehicle using the proper lift points (see Chapter 1, Safety, proper lifting points) Remove the lug nuts Remove the flat tire Place the spare tire Replace the lug nuts snug Lower the vehicle Torque the lug nuts (tighten them as much as possible after the vehicle has been lowered) Replace the tools in the appropriate location for future use. Carry the flat full-size tire to the tire shop with you. Spare tires are often smaller than the full-size tires that are regularly driven on. Spare tires are only meant to transport the vehicle to a tire shop when needed and should be changed as soon as possible. They should not be driven on regularly. Tire Disposal Any time you purchase a tire, the tire shop is responsible for charging a disposal fee and disposing the old tire properly. If for some reason you have to dispose of the tires yourself, you can take them to the city dump. The dump may charge\n",

Probably the most important number for the common person to recognize is the recommended tire pressure on the vehicle manufacturer(cid:1)s specifications on the driver(cid:1)s door jamb sticker. (The tire manufacturer(cid:1)s specifications on the tire itself include the maximum pressure that the tire can have, yet the maximum pressure isn(cid:1)t necessarily the best pressure for the vehicle). How to Check the Tire Pressure In order to check tire pressure you(cid:1)ll need a tire pressure gauge. Gauges can be purchased at auto parts stores and service stations (sometimes a little as $1, but could be $3-$7). They(cid:1)re usually about the size of a large pen, but can come in other forms. Sometimes a gauge is included with the air hose of the air dispensing stand at the gas station. Pen-sized tire pressure gauge Air dispensing hose at a gas station with built-in pressure gauge Round tire pressure gauge and hose Follow these steps to check and correct the tire pressure: Remove the valve cap of each tire Align the gauge up to the valve Press the gauge onto the valve with firm direct pressure and then release. You(cid:1)ll see the measuring stick get pushed out of the other side of the gauge (on a pen gauge). Fill the tire with air, recheck the pressure, then repeat as needed until the desired pressure is obtained. Replace the valve cap Tire pressure is measured in PSI (pounds per square inch) or KPA (Kilopascals) which are simply units of measurement for pressure. (Pressure is a force distributed over surface area) Checking the tire pressure Wheel Alignment Tires can wear rapidly if they are not aligned properly, or the vehicle can pull to one side while driving. There are three angle measurements that are used in tire alignment: camber, toe, and caster. Knowing these angles is necessary for any tire technician. In addition, knowing these angles can be helpful for anyone trying to communicate with tire technicians. In order to understand these angles one must consider the planes of the\n",
      "Notice how the handlebars are closer to the rear than the center point (fulcrum) of the front wheel. This is a clearly visible positive caster. The front wheels of shopping carts have a negative caster. The physics of a negative caster allows for the front wheels to turn counter clockwise as the cart is turning clockwise so that the cart is easier to maneuver throughout the store. Image shows a positive caster. Motor vehicles have positive casters which help the vehicle drive straight even with a hands-free steering wheel. A positive caster is easily seen on the front wheels of motorcycles and bicycles.

The wear bar indicates safe tread depth. It is usually about 1/16 of an inch measured from the valley of the tread, but not as high as the tread itself when the tire is new. As the tread wears down, the wear bar becomes more visible. When the tread is even with the wear bar the tires should be changed. Tires should be rotated with each oil change and kept in alignment to ensure even tread wear. Tire with arrows pointing to the wear bars between the treads. How to Change a Tire Knowing how to change a tire is mostly helpful in case you get a flat while driving on the road. Every other time your tires get removed, rotated and/or replaced it will be by a tire technician. Every vehicle has instructions for using the jack and other tools as necessary to change the tire. Some of the details can vary by make and model, such as the storage location for the jack and spare tire. Consult the owner(cid:1)s manual of the vehicle. Also, there will often be a sticker with instructions located with the jack and spare tire. Standard spare tire kit with spare tire, lug wrench, and tire jack.

Refer to the owner(cid:3)s manual to select the correct fluid. Aftermarket suppliers make fluids that are compatible with multiple different vehicles. When choosing aftermarket fluids, be sure that the specified fluid in the owner(cid:3)s manual is listed on the aftermarket bottle. Lubricants Used in Standard Transmission: The lubricants used in a standard (or manual) transmission on modern vehicles have multiple types of fluid. Be sure that the fluid installed in the vehicle meets the manufacturers specifications. Lubricants Used in Differentials: Most differentials use conventional 80-90 gear oil. The 80-90 numbers indicate the weight and viscosity of the oil. (These are similar to the API and SAE discussed in Chapter 5). Some vehicles require special fluids. Be sure the fluid meets the manufacturer(cid:3)s specifications. Limited slip differentials may require an additional additive. The Difference Between Front Wheel Drive, Rear Wheel Drive & Four Wheel Drive: The main differences between front wheel, rear wheel, and four wheel drive are the position of the drive train parts and where the drive train transmits the energy.

Some were taken from Chapter 4: Tires This chapter is all about tires. There may be more to these rubber doughnuts than many people realize. In this chapter we(cid:1)ll discuss tire specifications, how to check tire pressure, wheel alignment, the wear bar, how to change a tire, and old tire disposal. Tire Specifications There are two specification sets for tires including the tire manufacturer specifications and the vehicle manufacturer specifications. Whenever you take your car to a tire shop to get the tires changed, they have to meet these specifications by law. You can get a tire that goes above these specifications, but never below. The vehicle manufacturer(cid:1)s specifications include speed rating, load and size. It is located on a sticker in the driver(cid:1)s door jamb of the vehicle and in the vehicle owner(cid:1)s manual. When buying a new tire you(cid:1)ll want to stick with a tire that meets the manufacturer(cid:1)s specifications because that(cid:1)s the kind of tire that the vehicle was built to use. Vehicle Manufacturer specifications in the driver(cid:1)s door jamb of a vehicle. This indicates that the tires for this vehicle should be inflated to 30 PSI, except the spare which is 60 PSI. The tire manufacturer specifications include the tire size, load, pressure, temperature, speed rating and tread wear. The tire manufacturer specifications indicate what the tire is made to withstand. These specifications can be found on the wall of the tire itself. Tire manufacturer specifications on the tire wall which include various tire codes. Unless you become a tire technician, you don(cid:1)t have to know all the numbers on the tire or on the sticker/owner(cid:1)s manual because every time you get your tires replaced, the tire shop will make sure you at least have a tire that meets the required specifications.

The chart will include such information as when to change the oil, rotate tires, replace the air filter, inspect fuel cap and lines, change other fluids (transmission fluid, etc.) and other maintenance issues. Your vehicle may have different maintenance requirements at 30,000 miles, 90,000 miles, 150,000 miles and at other intervals as indicated specifically in your owner(cid:1)s manual. Being familiar with the maintenance chart in your owner(cid:1)s manual can help you save money when taking your car to the mechanic for maintenance checks. Sometimes the repair shop will suggest additional services that aren(cid:1)t necessary. If you don(cid:1)t have the owner(cid:1)s manual for your car then you may be able to find one online by using Google or another search engine. Search the website for the make of the vehicle. You could also try your local library. Vehicle Fluids: Vehicle fluids include brake fluid, engine oil, coolant, power steering fluid, windshield washer fluid, transmission fluid and battery fluid. Fluid level information and the location of each fluid reservoir can be found in the owner(cid:1)s manual for your particular vehicle. (Any images in this chapter are illustrative of one example and your vehicle may look different). Brake Fluid: On most vehicles the reservoir for brake fluid is clear. You can check the fluid without removing the cap. There will be a marking on the reservoir that indicates minimum and maximum level. You(cid:1)ll want to make sure that the level is between those two marks. This fluid should never need to be topped off during maintenance. Low fluid is an indication of a problem.

Completely drain the cooling system of all the water. Reinstall the thermostat Disconnect the reservoir and flush with the garden hose until water runs clear. Completely drain the reservoir. Connect the hoses and close the drains. Fill the cooling system with new coolant to manufacturers specification and distilled water. Use a 50/50 mixture of coolant and distilled water or pre-mixed coolant. Flushing the cooling system will not correct an overheating concern. If your vehicle is overheating, (as indicated on the temperature gauge on the dash), it would need to be diagnosed and repaired. Any time you open the cooling system and put it back together you want to pressure test the cooling system to check for any leaks. You can use a pressure tester which can be rented from an auto parts store. It will come with instructions. Generally, it attaches to the radiator where the radiator cap goes, and you pump it by hand until the pressure on the gauge matches the pressure that is written on top of the radiator cap. Typically on a modern vehicle this pressure is between 13 - 16 psi. Let the vehicle sit with this pressure for 20 - 30 minutes. Then inspect the entire cooling system for any leaks and check the gauge for a change in pressure. If there is less pressure than before then there is probably a leak. Pressure testing the cooling system Chapter 7: The Fuel System This chapter is about the fuel system. The fuel system is the system which pumps fuel into the cylinders of the internal combustion engine and mixes it with the perfect amount of air for combustion.

When the rear wheels are properly aligned they will be parallel (i.e. the distance between the front of the rear wheels is the same as the distance between the rear of the rear wheels). Image shows an inward toe of the front passenger tire. Measuring the distance between the front and back of the front tires as a pair and the rear tires as a pair. In this illustration, line a is shorter than line b, indicating an inward toe of one or both tires (both in this image). Lines c and d are equal in length, indicating a toe angle of zero. If a right wheel is turned inward while the left wheel is straight, or if both wheels are turned too far inward, or both are turned outward, etc., then there is an abnormal toe angle present and the wheels are not aligned. (Technically when you steer the vehicle and the front wheels turn to the left or right, they are deviating from the Y and Z planes, but they stay parallel to each other with only a slight variation to account for the fact that one wheel is on the outside and one is on the inside while turning). The caster angle is an angle which lies on the Y plane and deviates from the Z plane. (Imagine looking at the vehicle from the side). Most devices with steering capability do not have a caster angle of zero. When the deviation is towards the rear, the caster is considered positive. When the deviation is towards the front, the caster is considered negative. On motor vehicles the caster is usually positive, (the higher ball joint will be closer to the rear than the lower ball joint). This helps the vehicle to drive straight even when the steering wheel is hands-free. Since the view of the caster is blocked by the wheel on vehicles with four wheels, it is most easily visible on motorcycles and bicycles. Think of the two braces that come down on both sides of the front wheel. Notice how the handlebars are closer to the rear\n",

Severe engine failure will result if you continue to drive. For a few extra moments while you(cid:1)re finding a safe place to pull over, you can turn on the heater to high, which dissipates heat from the engine. If the heater does not work, it is an indication that the coolant level is low, and that the vehicle should not be driven. The dashboard may also have a temperature gauge which has a thermometer symbol. Throttle Control Warning Light: Yellow or orange. In some vehicles the throttle has an electronic control system. These lights indicate that there is a problem with the system. Have the vehicle serviced as soon as possible. In some makes and models the wrench light can be for other purposes. Be sure to consult the owner(cid:1)s manual. Tire Pressure Warning Light: Yellow or orange. This light indicates that one or more of the tires has fallen below 25% of the recommended pressure. Have the tires checked soon. Turn Signals and Hazard Light Display: These will only illuminate when a turn signal (left or right) or the hazard lights (both simultaneously) are turned on. If one stays on instead of blinking in rhythm or blinks slower or quicker than usual then there is a problem. One of the bulbs may need to be replaced or there is something wrong with the circuit.

Excessive discharging of the battery without the engine running (i.e. listening to the radio, keeping the cab lights on or using any accessory with the engine off) can cause the battery to overheat, which leads to early battery failure and leakage of battery acid. If the battery fluid is low, only use distilled water to refill it. Never add acid to a battery. The presence of corrosion indicates a problem that should be addressed. However, as a temporary fix, you can clean off the corrosion to get the car started. Start by rinsing off the corrosion with the garden hose. Then disconnect the terminals starting with the negative terminal first, then the positive terminal. Use a mixture of baking soda and water or battery terminal cleaner to rinse off the terminals and battery posts. You(cid:1)ll see the baking soda reacting with the corrosion to form fizz and bubbles. Use a wire brush or scraper (depending on the type of terminal) to clean the inside of the terminal and battery posts. Then rinse again with more water. Once the terminals and battery posts are clean, reattach the terminals starting with the positive terminal first, then the negative terminal. It is not sufficient just to clean off the corrosion. Again, the presence of corrosion indicates a problem that should be addressed. Car battery Fuses Consult the owner(cid:1)s manual to locate the fuse boxes in your vehicle.

If a rotor has any pits or grooves then it will have to be reconditioned or replaced. Check the thickness of all the brake pads. If there is any variation in the brake pad (or shoe) thickness between the driver side and passenger side, then there may be an adjustment problem, a defective caliper or other defective hardware. Usually the front brakes wear faster since the front brakes are responsible for about 80% of the stopping. There is no blanket measurement for brake pad thickness since the thickness of new pads can vary by make and model of the vehicle. A few millimeters could appear brand new in one car but be an indication for pad replacement in another. If the thickness of the pad is 20% of the original thickness or less, then the pads should be replaced. The original thickness can be found in the service manual for the vehicle. Chapter 11: The Auto Repair Industry Consumers should be aware of how the auto repair industry works.

      "brake shoes are the friction material. A wheel cylinder applies pressure to a brake shoe with a friction lining. Think of a circle within a circle. A hydraulic device expands the shape of the shoes to press against the drum. This generates heat and stops the vehicle. Illustration of a drum brake Drum brake shoes (violet color) and linings. The master cylinder is a hydraulic cylinder that is used to apply force to the brake calipers and/or wheel cylinders. The wheel cylinders (used in drum brakes) and the brake calipers (used in disc brakes) are both (cid:1)hydraulic slave cylinders(cid:2). Anti-lock brakes have complex electrical and hydraulic components which are used to avoid skidding wheels in a panic stop or in a poor traction condition. The anti-lock brakes (ABS) use signals from each wheel speed sensor to determine if one wheel is stopping faster than any of the others. If this occurs, the ABS control module (a computer) will signal the ABS hydraulic control unit to isolate that wheel, release brake pressure, and then pulsates the brake pressure to maintain equal speeds of all four wheels. This helps avoid skidding and maintains maneuverability during a panic stop. How to Check the Brake System: The brake system is often checked by the mechanic during routine oil changes and maintenance. However, it can also be checked at home. Consult the service manual of the specific make and model about checking the brakes and finding the locations of each part of the brake system. Follow these steps to check the brake system: Start under the hood. Check the brake master cylinder for leaks. Check the level and condition of the brake fluid. Inspect all lines and the anti-lock brake module for leaks or loose, damaged connectors. Raise the vehicle and support it securely on a lift or jack stands (review Lesson 1 if needed) Remove all four wheels If the vehicle has drum brakes, then remove the drums.

Any time you open the cooling system and put it back together you want to pressure test the cooling system to check for any leaks. You can use a pressure tester which can be rented from an auto parts store. It will come with instructions. Generally, it attaches to the radiator where the radiator cap goes, and you pump it by hand until the pressure on the gauge matches the pressure that is written on top of the radiator cap. Typically on a modern vehicle this pressure is between 13 - 16 psi. Let the vehicle sit with this pressure for 20 - 30 minutes.

      "Context:  Prior to 1985 most vehicles used a carburetor. A carburetor uses a venturi (narrowed passage within the carburetor) to draw fuel from a float bowl based strictly on the volume of air flowing through the carburetor. A carburetor is a primitive method of mixing air and fuel. It is far less efficient than modern fuel injection. That(cid:1)s why all modern cars today are built with fuel injection. How a Fuel Injection System Works: Fuel injection is a complex electrical circuit using multiple sensors as inputs to a PCM (powertrain control module, also called the computer). The PCM then interprets the inputs from these sensors and produces a PWM (pulse width modulated) signal. A PWM signal is a digital on/off signal. This translates into how much fuel is injected into the engine. The PCM then receives feedback signals from oxygen sensors. An oxygen sensor is a sensor that checks the air-fuel ratio by monitoring exhaust gas at or near the exhaust manifolds (review Chapter 5 if needed). Using this information, the PCM can adjust fuel trim accordingly to keep the engine running clean, long and efficient. This is one of the main reasons newer automobiles last so much longer, burn less fuel, and have cleaner emissions. Illustration of a fuel injector. Fuel Filter and Air Filter: There are two filters which protect the fuel system and engine: the fuel filter and the air filter. The fuel system is very sensitive to contamination and debris. A small amount of contamination can cause severe problems in any fuel system. Therefore, these filters are critical for protecting the fuel system and engine. A fuel filter (white) next to the air filter compartment (circular black part) When you fill your vehicle with fuel from a gas station, the fuel will have contaminants. Between the fuel tank and the engine the fuel passes through a sock filter which prevents large contaminants from passing through. Then the fuel will pass through the fuel filter which prevents small contaminants from passing. Anything that passes through the fuel\n",

      "passing. Anything that passes through the fuel filter can pass through the rest of the fuel system. Refer to the owner(cid:1)s manual to find the manufacturers recommendation for the mileage at which the fuel filter should be changed. An air filter protects the engine from dust and dirt entering the combustion chamber through the air intake system. Any dirt in the engine can cause engine wear and eventually lead to engine failure. Therefore, an air filter, like the fuel filter, is also a critical component in any internal combustion engine. The air filter is inspected with every oil change and it is changed as needed. (The air filter was also mentioned in Chapter 2 since checking it is part of general maintenance). Various air filters. Chapter 8: The Electrical System This chapter is about the electrical system of the vehicle. The main parts of the electrical system are the battery, alternator, and ignition system. The battery is the power source of the whole vehicle. The alternator is a re-charging device which is used to maintain the charge of the battery. The ignition system is used to ignite the fuel at the correct time during the Otto cycle of events (review Chapter 5 for the Otto cycle of events). Alternator Ignition System (prior to 1975) The (cid:2)ignition(cid:3) in this lesson is not the same as the key ignition; it(cid:1)s about the ignition system that is used in the engine to ignite the air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber. Prior to 1975, the ignition system consisted of the ignition coil, capacitor, contact breaker, distributor and spark plugs. The ignition coil converts low voltage electricity into high voltage. The high voltage electricity is sent to the distributor through the rotor, then it transmits out the distributor cap through plug wires to the spark plugs. The contact breaker or contact points complete and interrupt the circuit to the ignition coil on the low voltage side. The capacitor absorbs a voltage spike when the points open to avoid burning the contacts of the points. In a\n"

      "Context:  brake shoes are the friction material. A wheel cylinder applies pressure to a brake shoe with a friction lining. Think of a circle within a circle. A hydraulic device expands the shape of the shoes to press against the drum. This generates heat and stops the vehicle. Illustration of a drum brake Drum brake shoes (violet color) and linings. The master cylinder is a hydraulic cylinder that is used to apply force to the brake calipers and/or wheel cylinders. The wheel cylinders (used in drum brakes) and the brake calipers (used in disc brakes) are both (cid:1)hydraulic slave cylinders(cid:2). Anti-lock brakes have complex electrical and hydraulic components which are used to avoid skidding wheels in a panic stop or in a poor traction condition. The anti-lock brakes (ABS) use signals from each wheel speed sensor to determine if one wheel is stopping faster than any of the others. If this occurs, the ABS control module (a computer) will signal the ABS hydraulic control unit to isolate that wheel, release brake pressure, and then pulsates the brake pressure to maintain equal speeds of all four wheels. This helps avoid skidding and maintains maneuverability during a panic stop. How to Check the Brake System: The brake system is often checked by the mechanic during routine oil changes and maintenance. However, it can also be checked at home. Consult the service manual of the specific make and model about checking the brakes and finding the locations of each part of the brake system. Follow these steps to check the brake system: Start under the hood. Check the brake master cylinder for leaks. Check the level and condition of the brake fluid. Inspect all lines and the anti-lock brake module for leaks or loose, damaged connectors. Raise the vehicle and support it securely on a lift or jack stands (review Lesson 1 if needed) Remove all four wheels If the vehicle has drum brakes, then remove the drums. Inspect all brake lines and hoses for signs of leaking or cracking Inspect the caliper hardware and dust boots for damage\n",

Exterior lighting is checked with the key turned to the (cid:2)on(cid:3) position in the ignition (or with the engine running, but it(cid:1)s not necessary to have the engine running just to check the lights). Turn on the headlights. Check all four corners of the vehicle. On both sides (right and left, or driver side and passenger side) the same number of bulbs should be illuminated. There should be two front marker lights that are orange, two tail lights, and a license plate light. Rear lights of a vehicle with the brake lights illuminated. Turn the left turn signal on. Check the left front and left rear of the vehicle for blinking lights. Some vehicles have more than one bulb for the turn signal and some even include a signal in the side rearview mirrors. Be sure every applicable bulb is illuminating. Some vehicles have a cornering lamp, which is a clear lamp on the front of the vehicle which illuminates corners while turning. This should be illuminated but it will not blink. Turn the right turn signal on. Check the right front and right rear of the vehicle for blinking lights. Be sure all applicable bulbs are illuminating. Check the cornering lamp if applicable. When the turn signal is on and the indicator is blinking fast or not blinking at all, these are indicators of a failed bulb. Brake lights require two people for inspection. One person presses the brake pedal while the other person checks the rear of the vehicle to make sure all the brake lights are illuminating, including the high mount brake light in the rear window if the vehicle is equipped with one. Activate the hazard switch. Check to make sure that there are flashing lights with an equal number of bulbs on all four corners. The hazard lights are wired separately from the turn signals, so it is important to check the hazard lights even if the turn signals have been checked.

      "Context:  later in Chapter 9. An illustration showing pistons (gray) in their respective cylinders (blue) and a crankshaft (red). As the pistons go up and down the crankshaft is rotated. This image is animated at In a diesel engine there are no spark plugs. The fuel is ignited based on compression alone. The compression is higher on a diesel engine, which generates enough heat to cause the combustion. A hybrid vehicle uses an electric motor and battery for assisting propulsion along with the internal combustion engine. The internal combustion engine generates electricity to recharge the batteries. Also, the batteries are recharged when braking to a stop. Engine Oil Sample of motor oil The purpose of engine oil is to form a film of lubrication between all moving parts of an internal combustion engine to reduce friction and wear. Choosing the right engine oil for your vehicle and changing the oil during regularly-scheduled maintenance intervals will keep the engine running smoothly over time. The recommended oil type and specification for your vehicle can be found in the owners manual. Another place to find it is on the oil fill cap. It will be based on the ambient temperature where you live. There are two engine oil codes that the owner(cid:1)s manual will specify, an API and an SAE. All oil has an API code which stands for American Petroleum Institute. Its a service rating for the quality, cleanliness, and types of detergents in the oil. The code will always be two letters. The SAE is the viscosity or thickness of the oil. Modern oil is multi-viscosity oil. The SAE may be something to the effect of 5W-30. The first number-letter combo (5W) indicates the viscosity or thickness of the oil when it is cold. The second number is the viscosity at the engine operating temperature. Before they had multi-viscosity oil there was only single-viscosity oil (such as SAE 30), which in cold weather was extremely thick. Trying to pour it into your engine would be like pouring honey, but more importantly it would be hard to pump the oil\n",
      "the required specifications. Probably the most important number for the common person to recognize is the recommended tire pressure on the vehicle manufacturer(cid:1)s specifications on the driver(cid:1)s door jamb sticker. (The tire manufacturer(cid:1)s specifications on the tire itself include the maximum pressure that the tire can have, yet the maximum pressure isn(cid:1)t necessarily the best pressure for the vehicle). How to Check the Tire Pressure In order to check tire pressure you(cid:1)ll need a tire pressure gauge. Gauges can be purchased at auto parts stores and service stations (sometimes a little as $1, but could be $3-$7). They(cid:1)re usually about the size of a large pen, but can come in other forms. Sometimes a gauge is included with the air hose of the air dispensing stand at the gas station. Pen-sized tire pressure gauge Air dispensing hose at a gas station with built-in pressure gauge Round tire pressure gauge and hose Follow these steps to check and correct the tire pressure: Remove the valve cap of each tire Align the gauge up to the valve Press the gauge onto the valve with firm direct pressure and then release. You(cid:1)ll see the measuring stick get pushed out of the other side of the gauge (on a pen gauge). Fill the tire with air, recheck the pressure, then repeat as needed until the desired pressure is obtained. Replace the valve cap Tire pressure is measured in PSI (pounds per square inch) or KPA (Kilopascals) which are simply units of measurement for pressure. (Pressure is a force distributed over surface area) Checking the tire pressure Wheel Alignment Tires can wear rapidly if they are not aligned properly, or the vehicle can pull to one side while driving. There are three angle measurements that are used in tire alignment: camber, toe, and caster. Knowing these angles is necessary for any tire technician. In addition, knowing these angles can be helpful for anyone trying to communicate with tire technicians. In order to understand these angles one must consider the planes of the\n",

Engine oil should be checked each time the vehicle is refueled (i.e. each time you go to the gas station). Most engines, but not all, have a dipstick to indicate the oil level. Typically the handle is yellow. Follow these steps to check the oil: Turn the engine off. Remove the dipstick. Wipe off the end of the dipstick with a rag or paper towel. Put the dipstick back in. Take it out to look at the level at the tip The stick will have marks on it. The (cid:2)add(cid:3) mark typically indicates one quart low. If an engine is leaking oil then the price of repairs can vary depending on which repair is needed and the make and model of the vehicle.

If you(cid:1)ve just been driving then don(cid:1)t open it. After you think the engine has cooled then you can lightly touch the radiator cap to test it. If it(cid:1)s still hot, then don(cid:1)t open it. Opening the radiator cap while the engine is still hot can shoot a six-foot geyser into the air and burn any skin it contacts. The best time to check the coolant is in the morning before the car is driven. Coolant. Notice the green color; coolant can actually be any color (pink, orange, transparent, red, etc.) A low coolant level indicates a possible leak which should be investigated. A very small amount of evaporation of coolant can occur over time. As a rule, if you need more than one quart of coolant, that indicates a problem. If the coolant is low then it needs to be replenished with the proper type of coolant and mixture. Consult the owner(cid:1)s manual for the proper type of coolant. The proper mixture is a 50/50 ratio of coolant and distilled water. It is important to use distilled water because the impurities in\n"

You(cid:3)ll know to check the dashboard lights, the horn, the exterior lights, the battery, and many other parts of the vehicle because now you(cid:3)re familiar with how a vehicle works. You(cid:3)ll want to make sure it comes with a complete spare tire kit. Try looking down the side of the vehicle at different angles to see how the light reflects off the paint. If you detect two different coats of paint or areas where touch up paint has been applied then ask the seller about it. If the side panels and doors look smooth from one angle but then you detect some waviness when looking from a different angle, then the vehicle may have been in a side-impact collision and its safety features could be compromised. You(cid:3)ll want to test drive the vehicle. See how it handles, accelerates and brakes. Go to a stretch of road like a freeway onramp or a long stretch between street lights where you can floor it. At some point in the inspection, you(cid:3)ll ask for a Carfax report or any of the information the seller might have on previous maintenance and repairs. One of the smartest things you can do is take the car to a trusted mechanic as part of the evaluation. Find a place where you can develop a direct working relationship with the technician and not a service writer (review Chapter 11 for a description of service writers). Crawford(cid:3)s Auto Repair would be your best choice for a pre-purchase inspection if you live in the Mesa-Chandler-Gilbert area of Arizona. Some shops offer a free estimate but if they know you(cid:3)re requesting the evaluation to buy a vehicle, then they might charge for the inspection since there is less of a chance of you buying their repair services. The inspection fee will be worth it because the trained eye of the mechanic and the tools they use for diagnostics will enable them to spot things that you don(cid:3)t even know to look for.

Severe engine failure will result if you continue to drive. For a few extra moments while you(cid:1)re finding a safe place to pull over, you can turn on the heater to high, which dissipates heat from the engine. If the heater does not work, it is an indication that the coolant level is low, and that the vehicle should not be driven. The dashboard may also have a temperature gauge which has a thermometer symbol. Throttle Control Warning Light: Yellow or orange. In some vehicles the throttle has an electronic control system. These lights indicate that there is a problem with the system. Have the vehicle serviced as soon as possible. In some makes and models the wrench light can be for other purposes. Be sure to consult the owner(cid:1)s manual. Tire Pressure Warning Light: Yellow or orange. This light indicates that one or more of the tires has fallen below 25% of the recommended pressure. Have the tires checked soon. Turn Signals and Hazard Light Display: These will only illuminate when a turn signal (left or right) or the hazard lights (both simultaneously) are turned on.

Excessive discharging of the battery without the engine running (i.e. listening to the radio, keeping the cab lights on or using any accessory with the engine off) can cause the battery to overheat, which leads to early battery failure and leakage of battery acid. If the battery fluid is low, only use distilled water to refill it. Never add acid to a battery. The presence of corrosion indicates a problem that should be addressed. However, as a temporary fix, you can clean off the corrosion to get the car started. Start by rinsing off the corrosion with the garden hose. Then disconnect the terminals starting with the negative terminal first, then the positive terminal. Use a mixture of baking soda and water or battery terminal cleaner to rinse off the terminals and battery posts. You(cid:1)ll see the baking soda reacting with the corrosion to form fizz and bubbles. Use a wire brush or scraper (depending on the type of terminal) to clean the inside of the terminal and battery posts. Then rinse again with more water. Once the terminals and battery posts are clean, reattach the terminals starting with the positive terminal first, then the negative terminal. It is not sufficient just to clean off the corrosion. Again, the presence of corrosion indicates a problem that should be addressed. Car battery Fuses Consult the owner(cid:1)s manual to locate the fuse boxes in your vehicle. They can be anywhere in the vehicle. Modern vehicles use blade type fuses. The part of the fuse that you(cid:1)ll see initially is plastic and color-coded.

      "the vehicle won(cid:1)t start and it becomes necessary to use another vehicle for a jump start. Since jump starting a failed battery with a charged battery involves creating an electrical circuit, it is important to follow the right steps to perform a jump start safely: Do your best to line up the vehicles so that the two batteries are close enough to connect jumper cables. Turn off the active vehicle Verify there is no odor (like sulfur) coming from either battery. If there is a sulfur odor do not attempt to jump start the vehicle. The battery could explode due to the gas that is released (hydrogen gas). The next steps involve connecting the cables. When connecting cables to the first vehicle, which is the dead vehicle, make sure the other ends of the cables are not touching each other. First connect the red cable to the positive (red) battery terminal on the dead battery or to the jump start locations specified in the owner(cid:1)s manual. Connect the black cable to the negative terminal of the dead battery or to the jump start locations specified in the owner(cid:1)s manual. Connect the positive (red) cable to the positive terminal of the working vehicle (or to the specified jump start location in the owner(cid:1)s manual of the working vehicle). Connect the negative (black) cable to the negative terminal of the working vehicle (or to the specified jump start location in the owner(cid:1)s manual of the working vehicle) or to anything metal. The metal must be bare or without any paint that would inhibit conduction of electricity. The engine block is sufficient. Yet, the negative terminal is often the most accessible. o (More briefly the order is: dead red, dead black, live red, then live black. Red is always positive, black is always negative.) Start the working vehicle and allow it to run for approximately 5 minutes. Attempt to start the other vehicle. If the vehicle fails to start, there may be additional problems or the battery is no longer rechargeable. Take off the cables in reverse order (always remove\n",
      "off the cables in reverse order (always remove negative first) and make sure the cables don(cid:1)t touch each other as you(cid:1)re removing them o Remove the negative cable from the jumped vehicle o Remove the positive cable from the jumped vehicle (make sure they don(cid:1)t touch each other) o Remove the negative cable from the previously working vehicle o Remove the positive cable from the previously working vehicle. That may seem like a lot of steps above to memorize, so here are some tricks to remember the process: first connect the Dead Red, Fred. This phrase will help you remember that when connecting the cables you(cid:1)ll start with the positive cable on the dead battery. The order is dead red, dead black, live red, live black. Then it(cid:1)s the reverse order to remove the cables after the dead battery is jumped: First remove the Jumped Black, Jack. Remove the jumped black, jumped red, then the previously live black, then the previously live red. Never attempt to jump start a diesel vehicle. Since a diesel engine battery requires much more power, attempting to jump start it could damage the running vehicle. Typically you can attempt to jump start a hybrid car, but if the high power battery is dead, the vehicle will not start. However, a hybrid can be used to jump start a regular gasoline vehicle. Chapter 9: The Drive Train The drive train (drivetrain or powertrain) is a series of parts that transfer energy from the combustion engine to the wheels. If needed, review Chapter 5 to recall how the internal combustion engine works to convert chemical energy to rotational energy. The drive train has three main parts: the transmission, drive line or drive shaft, and differential. In some four-wheel drive vehicles a transfer case is also necessary.

So the test should be performed with the key turned to the (cid:2)on(cid:3) position in the ignition and the headlights turned on (the engine does not need to be running). Even with the key and headlights turned on, there is one other fuse that will not have power, which is the crank fuse. The crank fuse only has power when the key is turned to the crank position while starting the engine. This particular fuse does not need to be tested unless the vehicle won(cid:1)t crank. Belts & Hoses Two hoses and a belt are seen in this image If a belt squeals after starting the engine or while driving then this indicates a problem with belt tension. Most modern vehicles have automatic belt tensioners which keep the belt at the appropriate tension. Checking the belt tension varies by make and model. Modern vehicles only have one belt, but older vehicles have an individual belt for each accessory of the engine (i.e. power steering, air conditioning, and alternator). Consult a workshop manual for the proper methods for checking belt tension. (The workshop manual or service manual is different from the owner(cid:1)s manual and may be found at the local public library or ordered online). Belts can also be checked by visual inspection and touch for signs of cracking, fraying, or glazing. Glazing means the drive surface of the belt will be shiny. Hoses can be checked visually and by touch for signs of cracking, swelling, or leaks. If the engine is cool, then squeeze the hose to check for softness. If there is any variation from hose to hose within the same vehicle then that could indicate a problem. A cooling system pressure tester can be a useful tool to pressurize the cooling system and check for leaks or swollen hoses.

Severe engine failure will result if you continue to drive. For a few extra moments while you(cid:1)re finding a safe place to pull over, you can turn on the heater to high, which dissipates heat from the engine. If the heater does not work, it is an indication that the coolant level is low, and that the vehicle should not be driven. The dashboard may also have a temperature gauge which has a thermometer symbol. Throttle Control Warning Light: Yellow or orange. In some vehicles the throttle has an electronic control system. These lights indicate that there is a problem with the system. Have the vehicle serviced as soon as possible. In some makes and models the wrench light can be for other purposes. Be sure to consult the owner(cid:1)s manual. Tire Pressure Warning Light: Yellow or orange. This light indicates that one or more of the tires has fallen below 25% of the recommended pressure. Have the tires checked soon. Turn Signals and Hazard Light Display: These will only illuminate when a turn signal (left or right) or the hazard lights (both simultaneously) are turned on.

      "Context:  later in Chapter 9. An illustration showing pistons (gray) in their respective cylinders (blue) and a crankshaft (red). As the pistons go up and down the crankshaft is rotated. This image is animated at In a diesel engine there are no spark plugs. The fuel is ignited based on compression alone. The compression is higher on a diesel engine, which generates enough heat to cause the combustion. A hybrid vehicle uses an electric motor and battery for assisting propulsion along with the internal combustion engine. The internal combustion engine generates electricity to recharge the batteries. Also, the batteries are recharged when braking to a stop. Engine Oil Sample of motor oil The purpose of engine oil is to form a film of lubrication between all moving parts of an internal combustion engine to reduce friction and wear. Choosing the right engine oil for your vehicle and changing the oil during regularly-scheduled maintenance intervals will keep the engine running smoothly over time. The recommended oil type and specification for your vehicle can be found in the owners manual. Another place to find it is on the oil fill cap. It will be based on the ambient temperature where you live. There are two engine oil codes that the owner(cid:1)s manual will specify, an API and an SAE. All oil has an API code which stands for American Petroleum Institute. Its a service rating for the quality, cleanliness, and types of detergents in the oil. The code will always be two letters. The SAE is the viscosity or thickness of the oil. Modern oil is multi-viscosity oil. The SAE may be something to the effect of 5W-30. The first number-letter combo (5W) indicates the viscosity or thickness of the oil when it is cold. The second number is the viscosity at the engine operating temperature. Before they had multi-viscosity oil there was only single-viscosity oil (such as SAE 30), which in cold weather was extremely thick. Trying to pour it into your engine would be like pouring honey, but more importantly it would be hard to pump the oil\n",

      "car insurance can be a long process. Without a doubt there is a large percentage of car insurance customers who are paying more because they(cid:1)re too intimidated by the research that is required for finding the best deal. You should get used to the idea that you(cid:1)ll frequently need to call the insurance company and be put on hold to wait for a representative. Be adamant enough with the representatives to get the best deals and avoid getting ripped off, yet be courteous and professional enough so that the representative will still want to help you. Shopping for car insurance can start simultaneously with shopping for the vehicle. Some companies may be able to help you identify the vehicles with the lowest monthly insurance rates. Yet, some of them might not be able to provide a quote until you can tell them which vehicle you(cid:1)ll be driving. Besides the vehicle price, gas and insurance, there will be yearly fees for vehicle registration. You can find out the yearly registration fee by contacting your local Motor Vehicle Division (MVD or DMV) or your state(cid:1)s department of transportation. Some states require vehicle inspections and emissions testing before your vehicle can be registered. This information is also available at the DMV. There will also be costs for maintenance and repair. The best way to reduce these costs is by taking care of the vehicle and following the maintenance chart in the owner(cid:1)s manual. If the vehicle has a service light illuminated on the dashboard or if the vehicle starts to have symptoms - don(cid:1)t neglect it. Neglect will lead to further damage, which will require more expensive repairs. A simple example is brake pad replacement. Replacing the brake pads could cost about $200; but if you wait until the pads wear down completely and you start grinding metal on the rotor, then the repair could easily be $800 or more (review Chapter 10 for brakes). If the vehicle is well-maintained, it will last a lot longer -- maybe even 15 years longer or more. Overall, it\n",
      "Chapter 12: How to Buy a Car By contributing author Rex Kimball Buying a big-ticket item, like a vehicle, can be daunting, especially if the buyer doesn(cid:1)t know where to start. This chapter offers a beginner(cid:1)s guide to buying a vehicle. Yet, when it comes to buying a vehicle, serious buyers will go beyond the steps described here. For example, this chapter may mention the art of negotiation, yet entire books have been written on the subject of negotiating, and increasing one(cid:1)s skill in negotiation will help the buyer to get a better deal. One of the most important things for potential car buyers to know is that the majority of vehicles depreciate in value over time. If you purchase a new or used vehicle from a dealership, the vehicle depreciates by about 20% of the sale price the minute it is driven off the lot. That means that if you turned around and sold the vehicle within a week, you(cid:1)d probably only be able to sell it for about 20% less than you paid for it. It(cid:1)s not like buying a house where the property generally increases in value over time (except during economic decline). Vehicles are not investments; they(cid:1)re simply a necessary expense in locations that don(cid:1)t have good public transportation as an alternative. (They could be investments if you get involved in the collector(cid:1)s market, which is an entirely different game). It is also important to realize that the cost in owning a vehicle is much more than simply the sales price of the vehicle. All expenses must be considered before accepting the burden on your monthly budget. The sales price of the vehicle is just the beginning. If you(cid:1)re taking out a loan to pay for the vehicle then you(cid:1)ll first have the monthly loan payment. You(cid:1)ll also have to pay for gas to run the vehicle. The price of gas varies from week to week and by location. Wednesday is probably the best day of the week to buy gas.

You(cid:3)ll know to check the dashboard lights, the horn, the exterior lights, the battery, and many other parts of the vehicle because now you(cid:3)re familiar with how a vehicle works. You(cid:3)ll want to make sure it comes with a complete spare tire kit. Try looking down the side of the vehicle at different angles to see how the light reflects off the paint. If you detect two different coats of paint or areas where touch up paint has been applied then ask the seller about it. If the side panels and doors look smooth from one angle but then you detect some waviness when looking from a different angle, then the vehicle may have been in a side-impact collision and its safety features could be compromised. You(cid:3)ll want to test drive the vehicle. See how it handles, accelerates and brakes. Go to a stretch of road like a freeway onramp or a long stretch between street lights where you can floor it. At some point in the inspection, you(cid:3)ll ask for a Carfax report or any of the information the seller might have on previous maintenance and repairs. One of the smartest things you can do is take the car to a trusted mechanic as part of the evaluation. Find a place where you can develop a direct working relationship with the technician and not a service writer (review Chapter 11 for a description of service writers). Crawford(cid:3)s Auto Repair would be your best choice for a pre-purchase inspection if you live in the Mesa-Chandler-Gilbert area of Arizona. Some shops offer a free estimate but if they know you(cid:3)re requesting the evaluation to buy a vehicle, then they might charge for the inspection since there is less of a chance of you buying their repair services. The inspection fee will be worth it because the trained eye of the mechanic and the tools they use for diagnostics will enable them to spot things that you don(cid:3)t even know to look for. They(cid:3)ll look at the body of the vehicle\n"
